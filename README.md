tesb -> is best in the mirror. 

The logo for the site is the combination two letter bq.

Overview	
I want to do a website where the user can to request quotation for installation of tile instantly and from different installers. 
In this way the user could choose the best price, also see other jobs done by the installer. I plan to achieve this by allowing 
the installers to register and create their profile with their rates, experience and work done. I think that in this way the client
will be greatly facilitated in the quotation process for this type of work, in addition to the installers who will obtain a very 
good source to obtain new jobs.

Features
Register for installer and customer. (2 roles)
Login (As installer you can update his profile for example new rates, new jobs, etc.)
Quotation search. 
As customer you can post work to be done.
